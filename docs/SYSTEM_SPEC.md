```

## Deployable source contract

The production application intentionally has only:
1. `Code.gs` — backend/API/security/data/business/admin logic plus the bound-Sheet installer menu.
2. `User.html` — employee portal; Google Sites embedding is allowed.
3. `Admin.html` — Admin/Manager portal; direct Web App access only.
4. `SuperAdmin.html` — Super Admin portal and first-run wizard; direct Web App access only.
5. `appsscript.json` — Apps Script manifest.

No other `.gs` file is required for deployment. npm, Node.js, Playwright, GitHub Actions, and repository tests are development-only.

## Role surfaces

### USER portal
Timer, My Time, self-scoped Reports, Account.

### ADMIN portal
Manager workspace, assigned-workspace Reports, Account.

### SUPER_ADMIN portal
Super Admin control center, Manager workspace, Reports, Account, first-run setup.

Client-side portal separation is a usability layer only. Server-side `ACTION_PERMISSIONS`, session validation, workspace ACLs, and role checks remain the security authority.

## Authentication
- `handleClientRequest` is the application RPC bridge. `onOpen` is the only additional public simple-trigger function and only adds the harmless FLINK Time menu to the bound Sheet; every installer menu handler ends in `_` and is unavailable through `google.script.run`.
- Google Workspace domain-restricted web app.
- Server-observed Google Workspace email must match the FLINK account email.
- First-run root creation is owner-bound: **FLINK Time → Prepare Installation** records the Master Sheet owner, then Setup Step 1 requires both the active Google identity and the execute-as-deployer identity to match that prepared owner.
- Normal installation does not use or expose a one-time setup key. Legacy setup-key properties are deleted after successful root creation if they exist.
- `AUTH_MODE` defaults to `GOOGLE`: Google verifies the primary identity, and app MFA is mandatory. Legacy password code remains for compatibility tests and is inactive in this mode. Sessions enforce idle and absolute expiry plus account-epoch invalidation.
- High-risk Super Admin mutations require a short-lived step-up grant created after server-observed Google identity + fresh TOTP verification. Step-up rotates the authenticated session and binds the grant to the replacement SessionID.
- Authentication property writes admit at most 8,000 UTF-8 bytes per value and 400,000 bytes across the store, reclaiming only expired security records under the shared lock. This reserves headroom below Google's advertised limits; it does not eliminate execution/concurrency quotas.
- The sole root SUPER_ADMIN is a protected trust anchor: generic CRUD cannot demote it, deactivate it, re-bind its Google Workspace identity, or disable its MFA.

## Privileged storage boundary
- The Master Control Sheet, workspace Sheets, backup files, and Apps Script project are privileged infrastructure.
- Ordinary users must not receive direct Editor access to those resources; direct edit access bypasses application RBAC.
- Production should use a dedicated deployment/automation identity where possible.
- Admin and Super Admin portals are direct Web App pages and are not framed with ALLOWALL.

## Data integrity
Privacy requests and assurance evidence use two additive Master tabs. Existing installations initialize them through **Privacy & Assurance → Initialize or check privacy registries**. Requests are scoped to their subject; only the root owner can review all subjects or record assurance evidence, after step-up MFA. These workflows record decisions and evidence, not certification or automated erasure. Uncertain lifecycle execution enters `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` and cannot be approved again automatically.

- UTC storage.
- Workspace-local timezone/date/week interpretation.
- One active timer per user.
- Idempotent timer operations.
- Optimistic concurrency for time-entry mutation.
- Immutable timesheet submission membership.
- Explicit timesheet state machine.
- Canonical rollup rebuild from raw TimeEntries.
- Audit records are spreadsheet-canonicalized before HMAC calculation.
- Daily external checkpoints anchor the Master and each active workspace audit chain in Script Properties.
- Checkpoints include a full-prefix snapshot HMAC so legacy audit fields become sealed against later mutation.
- Privileged mutations require a successful pre-action audit write; if the security audit trail is unavailable, the mutation is blocked.

## Installation and repository policy

FLINK Time has two distribution paths.

### Automated installer

The preferred normal-user path is a separate standalone Apps Script installer. It runs as the user accessing it and has its own script-management scopes. Those broader scopes are not present in the five-file FLINK Time runtime.

The installer uses the official Apps Script API to create a bound project, upload the five production files from an immutable pinned release, create a version, create the Web App deployment, and return the deployment URL. It injects only the dedicated Master Sheet ID and installation-owner bootstrap sentinels.

API-installed copies have a first-run self-authorization gate. Before serving the normal portal, the gate activates only while an injected installation owner exists and durable installation-owner state is still absent. It verifies the signed-in owner and uses `ScriptApp.getAuthorizationInfo(ScriptApp.AuthMode.FULL)` to show Google's authorization URL if required. No production OAuth scope is added for this gate.

### Manual/template fallback

1. copy the Master Sheet in My Drive;
2. choose **FLINK Time → Prepare Installation**;
3. deploy the Web App as **Me** to the Google Workspace domain;
4. choose **FLINK Time → Open FLINK Time**;
5. open Super Admin and complete the GUI wizard.

The active source remains source-first. Compiled executables, temporary packaging output, legacy desktop clients, and duplicate Apps Script modules are not committed.

## Request-cost hardening (WP1 in progress)

Authenticated request paths no longer require whole-table scans for session token, account ID/username, credentials, or workspace-ID lookups. These hot-path reads use bounded TextFinder column searches followed by a single-row read.

Session validation uses a 5-minute ScriptCache entry keyed by the session token hash. Cache is an accelerator only: cache misses fall back to the durable Sessions sheet. Any durable session update/revocation invalidates the cached token, and mass revocation evicts all affected cached token hashes.

WP1 now also uses account/session epochs for constant-cost revoke-all: a session records the account epoch at creation, and security-sensitive account lifecycle operations invalidate existing sessions by rotating the account epoch instead of scanning the Sessions tab. Housekeeping later marks those stale rows revoked and purges them after seven days in contiguous batches.

Master/workspace schema repair also safely trims unused allocated rows/columns. It never automatically deletes populated columns beyond the known schema.

Remaining WP1 validation work is call-budget instrumentation and real-deployment timing. Bounded TimeEntries range reads belong to the year/data-book routing work that follows this foundation.
