# Current edition

The owner selected Google-managed primary sign-in plus app MFA. This release implements that selection and uses pinned TweetNaCl authenticated encryption for new MFA secrets. The PBKDF2 benchmark below is retained as historical background for the disabled app-password path. It is not an instruction to enable it. See [current evidence and remaining work](RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md).

# FLINK Time — Remaining Crypto Security Upgrade Plan

Status: **Prepared, not yet activated in production**

This plan covers the two security items intentionally left outside the previous hardening merge:

1. Upgrade password storage from the current PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 work factor of 10,000.
2. Replace the custom TOTP secret-at-rest encryption with Google Cloud KMS.

The rollout is deliberately split into measurable phases so production authentication is never changed blindly.

---

## 1. Current production baseline

### Passwords

Current format:

```
$pbkdf2$v1$i=<iterations>$<salt>$<hash>
```

Current work factor:

```
PBKDF2_ITERATIONS = 10000
```

The stored format already includes the iteration count. That means old and new hashes can coexist during a transparent migration.

### TOTP secrets

Current active and pending TOTP secrets are stored in the Credentials sheet.

Current encrypted format:

```
enc$v1$<iv>$<ciphertext>$<tag>
```

The encryption key is derived from the FLINK server pepper stored in Apps Script Script Properties.

This encryption is authenticated, but it is custom application cryptography. The target state is a managed Google Cloud KMS symmetric encryption key whose raw key material is never available to FLINK Time.

---

# Phase A — Measure PBKDF2 on the actual Apps Script runtime

## Prepared helper

A private Apps Script function is included in this branch:

```
benchmarkPasswordKdf_()
```

It:

- cannot be called through `google.script.run` because the name ends in `_`;
- never reads or modifies a real user;
- uses fixed non-secret benchmark input;
- measures the exact PBKDF2 implementation used by the Apps Script runtime;
- tests progressively larger work factors;
- stops early if execution becomes expensive;
- estimates the runtime of 600,000 iterations.

## How to run it

After this preparation code is deployed to the Apps Script development project:

1. Open the Apps Script editor.
2. Select `benchmarkPasswordKdf_`.
3. Click **Run**.
4. Approve existing permissions if Google asks.
5. Copy the returned/logged JSON result.
6. Record the values for:
   - 10,000 iterations
   - 25,000 iterations
   - 50,000 iterations
   - 100,000 iterations if it completes
   - estimated 600,000 runtime

Do not change `PBKDF2_ITERATIONS` yet.

## Decision rule

### Path A1 — 600,000 is practical

Use this path if the actual Apps Script runtime can perform the target work factor at an acceptable login latency.

Target implementation:

```
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
600000 iterations
32-byte output
16-byte unique salt
server-side pepper retained
```

Then implement transparent rehashing.

### Path A2 — 600,000 is not practical

If the pure Apps Script implementation would make authentication unacceptably slow, do **not** choose an arbitrary weak number just because Apps Script is slow.

Instead:

1. Keep the current verifier temporarily for legacy hashes.
2. Add a small native password-KDF service in Google Cloud.
3. Use native PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at the approved work factor, or Argon2id if the service design is changed accordingly.
4. Keep the FLINK application session/RBAC layer unchanged.
5. Migrate users transparently on successful password verification.

The benchmark decides between A1 and A2.

---

# Phase B — Password hash migration design

## New hash version

Use a new version marker rather than silently changing the meaning of `v1`.

Target format:

```
$pbkdf2$v2$i=600000$<salt>$<hash>
```

If the benchmark requires a native external verifier, the format must still include the algorithm/version/work factor explicitly.

## Backward-compatible verification

Verification order:

1. Parse the hash.
2. Reject malformed formats.
3. Verify using the work factor stored in that hash.
4. Constant-time compare.
5. If authentication succeeds and the stored version/work factor is below policy:
   - generate a fresh salt;
   - create the new hash using the approved target;
   - update `PasswordHash`;
   - do **not** force a user password change solely because the storage format changed;
   - do **not** increment `PasswordVersion` solely for transparent rehash, because the user's actual password did not change;
   - write a security/audit event such as `PASSWORD_HASH_UPGRADED`.

## Important MFA interaction

For MFA-enabled accounts, a correct password is only the first authentication factor.

The migration code must not weaken existing MFA behavior.

Recommended sequence:

1. Verify the password.
2. Determine whether rehash is required.
3. Preserve the existing MFA challenge logic.
4. Rehash only after a valid password has been established under the login-state lock.
5. Never create a FLINK session until MFA completes when MFA is enabled.

A user who knows the correct password but fails MFA may cause at most one storage-format upgrade; this does not authenticate that user or create a session.

## Rollout

1. Deploy verifier that understands both v1 and v2.
2. Keep v1 verification available.
3. Enable v2 hashing for all newly created/reset passwords.
4. Transparently upgrade v1 hashes after successful password verification.
5. Add reporting:
   - number of v1 hashes remaining;
   - number of v2 hashes;
   - last hash migration timestamp.
6. After the migration window, force password reset only for accounts that never returned and still use obsolete hashes.
7. Remove v1 **creation** immediately after cutover.
8. Remove v1 **verification** only when no valid legacy accounts remain.

# Phase C — Google Cloud KMS foundation

## Cloud project

Use a **standard Google Cloud project** associated with the Apps Script project.

The production Apps Script deployment identity must be intentionally controlled. Do not use a personal account that may leave the company.

Recommended names:

```
Project: flink-time-prod
Key ring: flink-time-security
Crypto key: flink-totp-secrets
```

Location should follow FLINK's organization/data-residency policy. Use one location consistently; do not recreate the same logical key in multiple locations.

## Enable Cloud KMS

Example:

```bash
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

## Create key ring

Example:

```bash
gcloud kms keyrings create flink-time-security \
  --location="$LOCATION" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

## Create software-backed symmetric key

Example:

```bash
gcloud kms keys create flink-totp-secrets \
  --location="$LOCATION" \
  --keyring="flink-time-security" \
  --purpose="encryption" \
  --rotation-period="90d" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

Use a symmetric `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` key.

## Least-privilege IAM

Grant the Apps Script deployment identity only:

```
roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
```

Grant it at the individual CryptoKey level rather than project-wide.

Example:

```bash
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding flink-totp-secrets \
  --location="$LOCATION" \
  --keyring="flink-time-security" \
  --member="user:$DEPLOYMENT_OWNER_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

Do not give the running application `roles/cloudkms.admin`.

Keep key administration and key use separated where practical.

---

# Phase D — Apps Script KMS integration

## Required manifest scopes

When KMS code is activated, add:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudkms
```

Keep all existing scopes.

If a URL fetch allowlist is used, restrict it to:

```
https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/
```

Because the project has explicit OAuth scopes, these scopes must be present before the KMS code can work.

## Authentication to KMS

Use:

```javascript
ScriptApp.getOAuthToken()
```

and send it to Cloud KMS through:

```javascript
UrlFetchApp.fetch(...)
```

with:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Do not store a Google service-account JSON key in Script Properties, Sheets, Drive, or source control.

## Configuration

Store only non-secret KMS resource metadata in Script Properties:

```
FLINK_KMS_KEY_RESOURCE=
projects/<project>/locations/<location>/keyRings/flink-time-security/cryptoKeys/flink-totp-secrets

FLINK_KMS_MODE=DUAL_READ
```

Allowed modes:

```
DISABLED
DUAL_READ
KMS_REQUIRED
```

The KMS key material itself never leaves Cloud KMS.

---

# Phase E — New TOTP ciphertext format

Use a versioned format:

```
kms$v1$<base64-kms-ciphertext>
```

KMS ciphertext already identifies the key version required for decryption, so key rotation does not require embedding the version separately in the FLINK record.

## Additional authenticated data

Bind each ciphertext to both purpose and user:

```
FLINK_TOTP_V1|<UserID>
```

Pass this value as Cloud KMS additional authenticated data on both encrypt and decrypt.

This prevents a valid encrypted TOTP secret from simply being copied from one user record into another user's credential row.

## Service boundary

Create a dedicated internal service such as:

```
KmsSecretService.encryptTotpSecret(userId, plaintextSecret)
KmsSecretService.decryptTotpSecret(userId, storedCiphertext)
```

TOTP verification should never call generic custom encryption directly.

---

# Phase F — Safe TOTP migration

## Stage 1 — Dual-read

Set:

```
FLINK_KMS_MODE=DUAL_READ
```

Behavior:

- `kms$v1$` → decrypt only through Cloud KMS.
- `enc$v1$` → decrypt with the existing legacy decryptor only for migration.
- unversioned plaintext → reject unless an explicitly controlled migration routine identifies an actual historical record that must be converted.
- new MFA enrollments → write only `kms$v1$`.
- MFA replacement → write only `kms$v1$`.

Never fall back from a failed `kms$v1$` decryption to the legacy decryptor.

## Stage 2 — Batch migration

Add a private/privileged migration job that:

1. reads credential records in bounded batches;
2. selects active `TotpSecret` and `PendingTotpSecret` values that are not already `kms$v1$`;
3. decrypts the old value locally;
4. immediately encrypts the raw secret with Cloud KMS and UserID-bound AAD;
5. writes the KMS ciphertext back;
6. verifies the new ciphertext by decrypting it through KMS before moving to the next record;
7. logs only UserID/status — never plaintext or ciphertext;
8. persists a migration cursor;
9. can safely resume after interruption.

For the current FLINK deployment size this should be operationally small, but it should still use the existing chunked-job pattern.

## Stage 3 — Verification

Required checks:

- no active account has `enc$v1$` in `TotpSecret`;
- no active pending enrollment has legacy ciphertext;
- every MFA-enabled user can complete a real TOTP login;
- Super Admin step-up works;
- audit logs contain no secret values;
- backup/restore tests pass with KMS ciphertext;
- KMS failures return controlled fail-closed authentication errors.

## Stage 4 — KMS required

Set:

```
FLINK_KMS_MODE=KMS_REQUIRED
```

At this point:

- all newly stored TOTP secrets must start with `kms$v1$`;
- normal authentication must reject legacy/unversioned secrets;
- legacy decryption code is inaccessible from normal login paths;
- a separate offline/manual migration/restore path may remain temporarily for old backups only.

---

# Phase G — Key rotation

Configure automatic symmetric-key rotation at 90 days unless FLINK policy requires another interval.

Rotation creates a new primary version for new encryption. Previous versions remain available to decrypt existing ciphertext until those versions are disabled/destroyed.

Do not destroy old key versions merely because rotation occurred.

Optional later maintenance job:

1. identify records encrypted before the current primary version;
2. decrypt with KMS;
3. re-encrypt with the current primary version;
4. verify;
5. only then consider disabling/destroying old versions after retention and backup requirements are satisfied.

---

# Phase H — Failure handling

## KMS unavailable

For an MFA-protected login:

- fail closed;
- do not bypass MFA;
- do not fall back to local legacy encryption for a `kms$v1$` record;
- return a generic temporary authentication/security-service error;
- log correlation ID, HTTP status, and KMS operation type;
- never log TOTP plaintext or KMS ciphertext.

Retries:

- no retry for 400/401/403;
- small bounded retry for 429 and transient 5xx;
- never retry indefinitely inside Apps Script.

## PBKDF2 migration failure

If legacy password verification succeeded but transparent rehash fails:

- do not corrupt the existing hash;
- keep the previous hash intact;
- record a migration failure event;
- authentication policy for that event must be decided explicitly during implementation testing.

Preferred production behavior is to preserve availability while leaving the old verified hash untouched, unless failure indicates a broader integrity/security incident.

---

# Phase I — Tests required before production

## Password tests

- v1 password still verifies.
- v2 password verifies.
- wrong password fails against both.
- malformed iteration count fails safely.
- work factor cannot be client-controlled.
- new account creates only target version.
- password change creates only target version.
- admin reset creates only target version.
- successful legacy verification upgrades hash exactly once.
- transparent rehash does not change PasswordVersion.
- concurrent legacy logins do not corrupt credentials.
- MFA-required login does not mint a session before MFA.
- timing comparison remains constant-time.

## KMS unit tests

Mock Cloud KMS transport and test:

- successful encrypt.
- successful decrypt.
- wrong UserID/AAD fails.
- malformed `kms$v1$` fails.
- 401/403 fail closed.
- 429 bounded retry.
- 5xx bounded retry.
- KMS ciphertext never appears in logs.
- no fallback from KMS failure to legacy decrypt.
- new enrollments write KMS format only.

## Migration tests

- `enc$v1$` active secret converts to `kms$v1$`.
- legacy plaintext historical fixture, if retained, converts once.
- KMS record is skipped idempotently.
- migration can resume from cursor.
- failure leaves original record intact.
- post-write KMS verification required before marking migrated.
- pending enrollment migration is safe.
- root Super Admin MFA continues working.

## Browser acceptance

Run existing user flow plus:

- Super Admin login with MFA.
- step-up authentication.
- MFA enroll/replace.
- user login with migrated KMS TOTP.
- password upgrade path.
- logout/session invalidation.

---

# Rollback rules

## TOTP

During `DUAL_READ`, keep the original legacy ciphertext until the KMS ciphertext has been successfully written and verified.

Never overwrite a legacy secret before a KMS decrypt round-trip succeeds.

If KMS rollout must be stopped:

- stop new migration jobs;
- remain in `DUAL_READ`;
- do not destroy the KMS key/version;
- do not rewrite KMS secrets back into custom encryption.

## Passwords

The verifier remains multi-version during rollout.

Rollback means:

- stop creating the new format;
- continue verifying both existing formats;
- never downgrade a v2 hash to v1;
- resolve the performance problem and resume migration.

---

# Definition of done

The two remaining findings are closed only when all of the following are true:

- production password hashes use the benchmark-approved strong KDF target;
- legacy password hashes are either migrated or subject to a forced-reset policy;
- no normal production path creates 10,000-iteration hashes;
- all active TOTP secrets use `kms$v1$`;
- no normal production authentication path relies on the custom secret cipher;
- Cloud KMS IAM is limited to the required key-use role;
- KMS automatic rotation is configured;
- Admin/deployment identities are documented and controlled;
- KMS outage behavior is fail-closed;
- password/KMS migration tests are green;
- Chromium acceptance is green;
- the final merged `main` workflow is green.
